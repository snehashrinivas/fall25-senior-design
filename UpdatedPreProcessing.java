/*
This program takes in a text file, parses its words, cleans their contents, and stores them in a database.
Cleaning words involves converting accented letters to their regular characters, removing miscellaneous
characters, converting words to lowercase, and adding end of sentence tokens. Lines are processed
one at a time, split into tokens, cleaned, and inserted into the database through the DatabaseManager
object. End of sentences are marked with "</s>".

The main purpose of this program is to count the total number of words in the file, store word frequency counts,
and end of sentence/beginning of sentence frequency counts.
